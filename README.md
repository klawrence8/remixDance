Final Project for Experimental Film

Instructions:
The arrows control which video is being played for each body partition.
Pressing the "Escape Space" button dismantles the conventional body structure by having initially the head video track the mouse.
Clicking the mouse will leave the video in that position. Anytime you click a video, it will follow the mouse. Clicking again
will then abandon the video. To return to the original layout, click the "Recapture Space" string. If it is no longer visible, 
the general area where you saw it last. Lol sorry you might just have to restart.
Pressing the "Escape Time" button allows the user to jump around randomly in the videos by clicking the corresponding drawing of
the body part. For instance, clicking the silhouette of the foot will cause the foot video to skip to another point in the video.
Pressing the "Recapture Time" string will disable this function.
